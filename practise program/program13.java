Java Program to Find GCD or HCF of Two Numbers
GCD (i.e. Greatest Common Divisor) or HCF (i.e. Highest Common Factor) is the largest number that can divide both the given numbers.


Lightbox

Example:

HCF of 10 and 20 is 10, and HCF of 9 and 21 is 3.
Therefore, firstly find all the prime factors of both the stated numbers, then find the intersection of all those factors that are present in both the given numbers. And at last, return the product of elements that are in the intersection.

Note: GCD of the two stated numbers doesnâ€™t alter if the smaller number is subtracted from the bigger number.

Example 1:

// Java program to find GCD of two numbers 

class GFG { 

    // Gcd of x and y using recursive function 

    static int GCD(int x, int y) 

    { 

        // Everything is divisible by 0 

        if (x == 0) 

            return y; 

        if (y == 0) 

            return x; 

  

        // Both the numbers are equal 

        if (x == y) 

            return x; 

  

        // x is greater 

        if (x > y) 

            return GCD(x - y, y); 

        return GCD(x, y - x); 

    } 

  

    // The Driver method 

    public static void main(String[] args) 

    { 

        int x = 100, y = 88; 

        System.out.println("GCD of " + x + " and " + y 

                           + " is " + GCD(x, y)); 

    } 
}
